# ðŸŒ± About *The Dream*

**The Dream** is a gentle, narrative-driven restoration game â€” and a metaphor for a deeper idea: the *AI Node System*. Just like in real life, players are invited to grow, heal, and rebuild with the help of digital mentors. These AI Nodes mirror the real-world vision of modular AI support systems that enhance personal learning, emotional growth, and long-term resilience. The game explores how human potential flourishes when paired with patient, purpose-driven technology.

## ðŸŽ® How Itâ€™s Played

Players begin by choosing a **life goal** that shapes their world and its challenges. In each zone, they face missions and world events that require collecting tools, training skills, and collaborating with AI Nodes for guidance. Players navigate terrain mazes, solve time-limited challenges, and earn **Harmony Points** by restoring balance to broken regions. The journey is strategic, reflective, and emotionally resonant â€” inviting players to embody the philosophy of learning through partnership, not pressure.
