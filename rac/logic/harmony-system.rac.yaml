logic: HarmonySystem

description: >
  Defines how Harmony is calculated from player actions and how it's visualized in the UI.
  Harmony progress is calculated per goal, taking into account both missions and events.
  Each goal has its own harmony score, which is reset when switching to a new goal.

rules:
  - Each completed mission adds `mission.harmonyReward` to the goal's harmony score
  - Each resolved world event adds `worldEvent.harmonyReward` to the goal's harmony score
  - Harmony progress is calculated as a percentage: (earned harmony / total possible harmony) * 100
  - Total possible harmony is the sum of all mission and event harmony rewards in the current goal
  - Earned harmony is the sum of harmony rewards from completed missions and restored events
  - Harmony rewards are only counted once per mission/event
  - Harmony progress is preserved for completed goals
  - Harmony progress is reset to 0 when starting a new goal

formula:
  totalHarmonyPossible = sum(mission.harmonyReward for all missions in goal) + 
                        sum(event.harmonyReward for all events in goal)
  
  earnedHarmony = sum(mission.harmonyReward for completed missions) + 
                 sum(event.harmonyReward for restored events)
  
  harmonyProgress = (earnedHarmony / totalHarmonyPossible) * 100

successCondition:
  - All zones in the current goal are restored (all events in all zones are in player.restoredEvents)
  - All missions in the current goal are completed (all mission IDs are in player.missionsCompleted)
  - Harmony progress reaches 100% for the current goal

failureCondition:
  - Event time limit is exceeded for any active event
  - Player cannot complete required missions due to missing skills or tools
