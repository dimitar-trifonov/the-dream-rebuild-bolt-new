# ðŸ“˜ harmony-system.rac.yaml

logic: HarmonySystem

description: >
  Defines how Harmony is calculated from player actions and how it's visualized in the UI.

rules:
  - Each completed mission adds `mission.harmonyReward` to `player.currentHarmonyScore`
  - Each resolved world event adds `worldEvent.harmonyReward` to the same
  - Zones are marked as "Restored" when their mission and event are both complete

formula:
  currentHarmony = sum(harmonyReward from all completed missions and resolved events)
  harmonyRatio = currentHarmony / totalHarmonyPossible

successCondition:
  - All zones restored AND
  - currentHarmonyScore â‰¥ 500 (or goal-specific threshold)
