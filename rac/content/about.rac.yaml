      The Dream is a narrative restoration game where players partner with AI Nodes to heal a broken world.
      Through exploration, skill development, and intentional choices, players regenerate damaged ecosystems
      and rebuild trust in human-AI collaboration.

    body: >
      Players select a life goal, navigate zones, collect tools, train skills, and resolve events. Every completed
      mission contributes Harmony points toward the global healing effort. Zones evolve visually from Damaged
      â†’ Healing â†’ Restored, showing the player's impact.

  - title: "Philosophy"

      The Dream is a metaphor for growth. It teaches patience, intentionality, and the power of supportive systems
      â€” including AI â€” when designed with empathy and care.
